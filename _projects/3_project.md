We have reconstructed the evolutionary history of intron presence/absence in fungi and found a general bias towards intron loss over intron gain {% cite lim2021analysis %}. We estimate that all modern species have experienced a net reduction in intron number from an initially highly intron-rich fungal ancestor (>8 introns per kilobase, more than modern humans). Interestingly, we find that these intron gain and loss events have given rise to exons that are 6-fold larger than average exons. Some introns are well conserved across species and even harbour functional noncoding RNAs.
