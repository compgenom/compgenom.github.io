We are investigating a new mechanism that regulates gene expression through upstream open reading frames {% cite lim2018exon %}. We estimate that ~30% of messenger RNAs are regulated by this new mechanism. We are developing computational and experimental methods (e.g., quantitative proteomics) to study this new mechanism.
