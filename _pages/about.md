Welcome to the website of [Dr Chun Shen Lim](https://compgenom.github.io/cv/)'s computational genomics group. We focus on delineating molecular factors that control gene expression. We develop high-throughput experimental techniques and computational pipelines to address the fundamental questions of cellular processes. We aim to address health issues and infectious diseases, e.g., hepatitis B virus infection, using eukaryotic model systems.
