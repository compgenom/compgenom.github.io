Welcome to the website of Dr Chun Shen Lim's research group. Our research focuses on delineating molecular factors that control gene expression. We develop high-throughput experimental techniques and **comp**utational **genom**ics pipelines to address the fundamental questions of cellular processes. We aim to address health issues and infectious diseases, e.g., hepatitis B virus infection, using eukaryotic model systems.
