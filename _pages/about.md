Welcome to the website of [Dr Chun Shen Lim](https://compgenom.github.io/cv/)'s computational genomics group. We aim to delineate molecular factors that control gene expression using high-throughput techniques and computational pipelines we develop. Our goal is to address health issues and infectious diseases, e.g., hepatitis B virus infection.
